# OCT4LLM
One click tool for LLMs

## **Overview**  
Revolutionize your approach to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with our all-in-one platform. Effortlessly train and deploy models with a single click. No structured data? No problem! Our built-in data pipeline seamlessly transforms unstructured datasets into structured, trainable formats—enabling businesses to focus on innovation while we handle the complexity.

## **Problem Statement**  

- Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is complex and resource-intensive.  
- Traditional fine-tuning requires structured data, limiting flexibility for businesses with unstructured datasets.  
- Businesses often lack the infrastructure and expertise to fine-tune models effectively at scale.  
- The fine-tuning process is time-consuming, slowing down AI adoption and deployment.  
- Unstructured data, which constitutes a majority of real-world data, is underutilized in model training.  

This creates a barrier for businesses needing customized AI solutions but lacking the necessary resources to make the most of LLMs.


## Installation

- Setup Docker

- Build Docker image

```bash
  docker build -t cuda_pytorch_docker .
```

    
- Run Docker container

```bash
  Docker run --gpus all -it --rm -v <your folder path>:/OCT4LLM cuda_pytorch_docker
```


## **Business Value**  

- **Boost Efficiency & Cut Costs**: Simplify the fine-tuning process and reduce infrastructure needs.  
- **Unlock Data Potential**: Leverage both structured and unstructured data for smarter insights.  
- **Scale & Innovate**: Quickly deploy customized AI models across multiple use cases, gaining a competitive edge.

## **Who Needs This? (Client and Market Value)**  

- **SMEs**: Easily fine-tune powerful AI models without heavy infrastructure or technical expertise.  
- **Data-Intensive Industries**: Maximize unstructured data for smarter decision-making, especially in sectors like healthcare and e-commerce.  
- **AI Developers & Startups**: Simplify model training and deployment for faster innovation.  
- **Enterprises Scaling AI**: Efficiently deploy customizable AI models across various applications.

## **Use Cases**  

1. **Business Chatbots**: Fine-tune models to create intelligent, domain-specific chatbots for customer support and engagement.  
2. **One-Click Classifier Models**: Deploy sentiment analysis, content categorization, and other classification models in minutes.  

## **Challenges & Technical Considerations**  

- **Model Quantization Variability**: Fine-tuning different architectures requires optimized quantization strategies.  
- **Inference and Training Optimization**: Reducing computational overhead without sacrificing accuracy.  
- **Unstructured Data Processing**: Transforming unstructured data into structured formats for efficient model training.

## **Future Roadmap**  

- **Knowledge Distillation**: Transfer knowledge from larger models to smaller ones for improved performance.  
- **Cloud-Based Deployment**: Enable scalable, cloud-based training and deployment for easier access.  
- **User Interface Enhancements**: Continuously improve the platform’s UI/UX for better user experience.  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Integration**: Expand capabilities to enhance data retrieval and knowledge augmentation in future updates.

## **Hosted Application Availability**  

- The **hosted link will be available for the next 72 hours** after submission. After that, the link will no longer be active.  
- We will update the **GitHub repository with a new link** for the next **10 days**, but beyond that, we cannot continue hosting due to high computational costs.  
- **For participants**: Please run the application **locally using Docker** to avoid overloading the hosted server.  
- **For judges**: You can access the application via the provided URL during the review period.  

**Note**: Each model training process may take several hours, so **patience is key** as you wait for the models to be ready for download or deployment.
